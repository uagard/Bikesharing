# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
# Purpose
The goal of the study was to collect the data from the Citi Bike programm from New York City. This data was used to determine whether it could be recreated and applied in De Moines, Iowa. The main focus in this research was to clean up the data. I had to use Python's pandas package and then produced visuals using Tableau.

# Results
In order to complete this analysis, I used Python's pandas library to clean up the data and then created visualizations of that data using Tableau. Throughout this analysis I wanted to answer the following questions:

How long do users ride their bikes?
Who uses the bikes?
To and from where are they bicycling?
When do people utilise the bikes?
The previous questions were answered with the use of the following visualizations.

How long do users ride their bikes?
The graphic below shows the length of each bike trip. THe data shows that cyclists like to use the bicycles for 2 to 15 minutes on average.

Who uses the bikes?
According to the data the majority of the users were males.

The findings of the data below shows that the most common user is a male subscriber. A subscriber is defined as someone who has signed up for a long-term contract with citi bike. It has been determined they will ride mostly on Thursday.

To and from where are they bicycling?
The next two diagrams show where the most popular beginning and ending points are. It has been deteremined that most trips begin in Manhattan's most populated neighbourhoods. These areas are located in mid and lower Manhattan. It is also noticed that because of the shorter trip times, the finishing points are in the same densely populated areas. top_starting_locations

When do people utilise the bikes?
This image shows that weekday rider traffic peaks usually around commuting hours, but weekend ridership is more evenly distributed throughout the day. ![Trips_by_Weekday_per_hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102105537/176080511-c907d6ae-ad18-4854-8f79-81b3a8415585.png)

To add to these findings, this image shows that similar patterns are also noticed when genders are separated. ![User_trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102105537/176080537-824cd405-70a5-4fc4-ac5c-f7aa1276f14d.png)

# Summary
The following findings are the most important takeaways from the research and the above results. These will be used to ensure that the project in De Moines, Iowa can be successful program.

The main target for advertising is men, THey are the primary users.
It is extremely important that bikes are located in densely populated areas.
An incentivized program should be implemented. This could possibly encourage people to utilize the bikes during typical commuting hours during the week.
