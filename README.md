# New York City Citi Bike Analysis
# Purpose
The goal of the study was to leverage data from the Citi Bike programme in New York City to determine whether it could be replicated in De Moines, Iowa. To finish this research, I cleaned up the data using Python's pandas package and then produced visuals using Tableau.

# Results
In order to complete this analysis, I used Python's pandas library to clean up the data and then created visualizations of that data using Tableau. Throughout this analysis I wanted to answer the following questions:

How long do users ride their bikes?
Who uses the bikes?
To and from where are they bicycling?
When do people utilise the bikes?
To answer these questions I came up with the following visualizations.

How long do users ride their bikes?
During the month of August in 2019, this graphic depicts the length of each bike trip. It reveals that cyclists like to cycle for 2 to 15 minutes on average.

Who uses the bikes?
The majority of users are males, as seen in this depiction of riders by gender and duration of time.

To add to these findings, this graphic reveals that the most common user is a male subscriber (i.e., someone who has signed up for a long-term contract with citi bike) who rides on Thursday the most.

To and from where are they bicycling?
These two diagrams depict the most popular beginning and ending points. The first thing to keep in mind is that most trips begin in Manhattan's most populated neighbourhoods, which are located in mid and lower Manhattan. Second, because of the shorter trip times, the finishing points are likewise in the same densely populated areas. top_starting_locations

When do people utilise the bikes?
This image demonstrates that weekday rider traffic peaks around conventional commuting hours, but weekend ridership is more evenly distributed throughout the day. trips_by_weekday_per_hour

To add to these findings, this image demonstrates that similar patterns exist when genders are separated. user_trips_by_gender

Summary
These are the most important lessons from the above results for establishing a successful citi bike programme in De Moines.

Men should be targeted in advertising because they are the primary user group.
Bikes should be located in densely populated locations.
Provide incentives to encourage everyday use during typical commuting hours during the week.
